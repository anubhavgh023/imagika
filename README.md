Overview
Imagika is a high-performance image proxy server designed to efficiently serve high-resolution images (e.g., 4K) while optimizing performance through LRU caching and rate limiting. It consists of three main components:

Frontend: A user-friendly interface to load and display images.

Origin Server: Stores and serves high-resolution images.

Proxy Server: Acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the origin server, caching images to reduce load times and improve scalability.
